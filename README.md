# Repository Overview - Ransomware detection using sample entropy and graphical models: a methodology for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in cybersecurity

This repository contains **(i)** the dataset provided by *Anand, P. Mohan; Charan, P. V. Sai; and Shukla, Sandeep K.* for **“HiPeR — Early detection of a ransomware attack using hardware performance counters”**, and **(ii)** the code used in our article/experiments built on top of that dataset.

## Required citation for dataset use
If you use the **HiPeR** dataset in any form (including subsets, derivatives, or re-distributions), **you must cite the original article** by the dataset authors:
